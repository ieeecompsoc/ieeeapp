    <!-- About IEEE MSIT page text -->
    <string name="para1_about_ieee_msit">It was the onset of the year 2009. IEEE, USA was celebrating its 125th anniversary. Thousands of miles away, a new student branch was being formed with a mere strength of around 30 members. Without any guidance or previous experience, the Branch Counselor and her ExeCom were struggling hard to give this student branch an orientation and structure. After one year, the student branch was termed as the fastest upcoming branches in the entire Delhi Section, while the branch counselor received the rare honour of \“Best Branch Counselor of an Upcoming Branch\” at the Annual General Meeting of IEEE, Delhi Section. Yes, the branch is none other than our own college, i.e. Maharaja Surajmal Institute Of Technology.</string>
    <string name="para2_about_ieee_msit">The student branch of MSIT was registered with IEEE, USA in March, 2009 and it marked the beginning of the journey of IEEE, MSIT onto the path of constant upgradations and developments. The reins of this newly formed branch were given in the capable hands of Ms. Suman Mann, Reader, IT Department and she assumed the responsibility of Branch Counselor, IEEE, MSIT.</string>
    <string name="para3_about_ieee_msit">Many seminars and workshops were organized by the IEEE Student Branch in its
        endeavor. These included a workshop by Mr. Ankit Mittal on Basic Robotics and Autonomous Robots, which was held
        in collaboration with IEEE, Delhi Section. Similarly, a 2-day workshop on Wireless/Autonomous Robotics, I-MANIA, was organized at the campus in collaboration with OSUM-MSIT. Both the events were a huge success. By the year end, an IEEE awareness seminar was held with guest speakers from IEEE, DTU (formerly DCE). It helped create awareness among the students about the benefits of joining IEEE and helped in the rise in number of memberships in the present academic year.</string>
    <string name="para4_about_ieee_msit">IEEE-MSIT is gradually becoming a name which engineers of various institutes have started to recognize. As Robert Frost once said… \“Miles to go before I sleep, Miles to go before I sleep.\”</string>

	<p style="text-align: justify;">IEEE Computer Society through its endeavors has always been instrumental in conducting popular coding competitions round the year which are eagerly awaited by the whole student comrade.</p>

	<p style="text-align: justify;">Following the trend, IEEE Computer Society, organized Codestart - The competitive programming competition on 31st October this year. The event was organized in MSIT labs.</p>

	<p style="text-align: justify;">Around 32 teams, i.e. 100 students from various streams and years participated in the competition to showcase their skills and to prove their mettle on ground zero. The winning team was awarded certificates and cash prizes.</p>

	<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Machine Learning (29th January 2016)</b></p>

	<p style="text-align: justify;">The computer society has been crucial in popularizing some of the latest market trends for fresher advancements. Thus, the event not only polished the technical skill set of the students but also provided them with plethora of opportunities.</p>

	<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Introduction to Machine Learning on 29th January 2016(Friday)</b></p>

	<p style="text-align: justify;">The session was taken by Mr. Karan Hora, final year student of CSE department, MSIT. It was attended by about 50 students from different streams and branches.</p>

	<p style="text-align: justify;">The session gave an introduction to machine learning to the students, including supervised learning, CART model, random forest, neural networks, etc, deep learning, reinforcement learning, real time twitter sentiment mining, etc. Students were shown examples of recommendation system used in YouTube. Also, a live example of different Self Taught Game Playing AI was demonstrated by the trainer. Students showed great interest in the topic and session ended with success.</p>

	<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Summer Mentored Projects (15th June 2016 – 31st&nbsp;July 2016)</b></p>

	<p style="text-align: justify;">IEEE MSIT Computer Society Student Branch organised a project mentorship program for all Computer Society members. Siddarth Goyal, Mayank Kashyap and Devika Mehra were assigned as the mentors for guiding students to develop basic understanding of Python, Ruby on Rails and Android Development. It was attended by 8 students of the Computer Society.</p>

	<p style="text-align: justify;">The Python session enlightened the students to learn the necessary skills one needs to start developing websites using python. Under the mentorship, http://www.freahers.xyz and https://bhavya-blogs.appspot.com were the successful end products developed by the students. The website was not only based on the concepts of python but also included the knowledge of Google App Engine, Jinja2, CSS and javascript. It was an encouraging and enriching experience for students.</p>

	<p style="text-align: justify;">The session on Ruby on Rails was a reinforcing session for the fresher. The students were groomed to develop web applications using Ruby. They were given the privilege to work on IEEE website. The work was done on both backend and frontend. The students were taught how to make developing web application easier and fun to code. The session will not only help students develop websites but also assisted them to step in the field of Open Source Development.</p>

	<p style="text-align: justify;">The session on Android App Development was an advantageous program for all the students involved. It assisted students to develop an insight in the field of Mobile Development. The session started with the basic knowledge of Java and XML. Students were then lead to the basic development of Android with all its layout, views and listeners. The students were aided to maintain their data on the server. The students felt encouraged to learn a new skill and were inspired to put it to some great use. Student showed a great interest during the session and made the mentorship a great success.</p>

	<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Boot Camp (13th August 2016) </b></p>

	<p style="text-align: justify;">A boot - camp was organized in association with Coding Ninjas by IEEE MSIT Computer Society on 13th August 2016. The theme of the boot - camp was to help the students “Kick - start with their programming career.”</p>

	<p style="text-align: justify;">The primary speaker was Ankush Singla, an alumni of Stanford University and IIT – Delhi. He has an experience of working at bigwigs like Amazon and Facebook. He is a code enthusiast and has gained a lot of expertise in this field. The event started with a warm welcome to the dignitary by our respected Deputy Director, Prof. Poonam Bansal. The event was attended by enthusiastic freshers and some students of second and third year. The attendees varied over the all branches.</p>

	<p style="text-align: justify;">Initially, Mr. Singla helped the students to develop the skills required by a programmer. Starting from the very basic to the intermediate level of coding, students learned a lot. Most of the students carried their laptops with them. The basic programs were not only discussed, but also implemented by the students using an IDE.</p>

	<p style="text-align: justify;">All the attendees thoroughly enjoyed the session. Mr. Singla also encouraged the students to enhance their programming to the fullest. He broadens the horizon for all the students by making them aware of the plausible field, they should be working on so as to utilize their capabilities to the fullest. The various options highlighted by him were Competitive programming, Mobile development, Web Development and Open Source Development.</p>

	<p style="text-align: justify;">The event was a great success. It provided the students with the much needed skill and encouragement to start their programming career. The knowledge gained by them would help them explore the various domains.</p>
